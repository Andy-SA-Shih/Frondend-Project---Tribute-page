        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Kobe Bryant's life:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>1978</strong> - Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</li>
        <li>
            <strong>1984</strong> - When Bryant was six, his father retired from the NBA and moved his family to Rieti 
            in Italy to continue playing professional basketball.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1991</strong> - When Bryant was 13, he and his family moved back to Philadelphia, 
            where he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1996</strong> - Bryant was drafted 13th overall by the Charlotte Hornets, 
            but they traded their No. 13 pick to the Lakers the day before the draft, enabling the Lakers to get Bryant.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>1999-2002</strong> - Bryant and his then-teammate Shaquille O'neal won three consecutive
            champions during those three years. At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2009-2010</strong> - Bryant and his then-teammate Pau Gasol won
            two consecutive champions during those two years. For the 2010 playoff, 
            the Lakers won a Game 7 against the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals the first time ever.
             Bryant said that this was the most satisfying of all of his five championships.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2013-15</strong> - Bryant suffered from several injuries. The Lakers were
            in their dark era in terms of the game of winnings.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2016</strong> - In the season finale on April 13, Bryant scored an NBA season-high 60 points against Utah 
            in his last NBA game, outscoring the entire Jazz team in the fourth quarter, 
            in the Lakers' victory. He became the oldest player to score 60 or more points in a game at 37 years and 234 days old. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2018</strong> - On October 23, 2018, Bryant's book The Mamba Mentality: 
            How I Play, was published by MCD / Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 
            The book looks back on his career with photos and his reflections.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2020</strong> - Bryant died in a helicopter crash in California along with 
            his 13-year-old daughter Gianna. He was 41.
